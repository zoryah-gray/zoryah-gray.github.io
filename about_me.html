                    Bio
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Zoryah Gray. I am a QuestBridge Match Scholarship Recipient from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am a current junior at Northwestern University, graduating in June 2025, and I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of school, I enjoy graphic design, writing, reading, making video games, and listening to music. I have had the opportunity to apply my graphic design skills by creating business cards for an aspiring bakery. Additionally, in my role as publicity chair for the Rainbow Alliance, I have designed over 20 promotional graphics for various events. Further, I recently became the External President for Rainbow Alliance. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently working with a Blockchain group at Northwestern to create a remittance app for Blockchain protocols. In my free time I am working on developing a 2D adventure platformer and a 3D mystery game. I really enjoy working on front-end development to create seamless and visually appealing designs to enhance user experiences. Lately, I am interested in working in backend development and learning efficient backend protocols and systems to enhance my UI/UX skillset.
